    DESCRIPTION
        "PeriodicTime is used only to set the 'phase' of the GPS scan. The
         actual value of PeriodicTime can be arbitrarily far into the past or
         future.
         For example, if PeriodicInterval is 86400 (a day) and if PeriodicTime
         is set to UTC midnight on some day (in the past, present, or future)
         then periodic GPS scans will occur every day at UTC midnight. These
         MUST begin on the very next midnight, even if PeriodicTime refers to
         a day in the future.
         The Unknown Time value indicates that no particular time reference
         is specified. That is, the CPE MAY locally choose the time reference,
         and needs only to adhere to the specified PeriodicInterval.
         If absolute time is not available to the CPE, its periodic GPS scan
         behavior MUST be the same as if PeriodicTime parameter was set to
         the 'Unknown Time' value.
         The absolute UTC time will be specified as follows (ref: RFC1902):
         YYYYMMDDHHMMZ,
         where:
           YYYY - four digits of year

             MM - minutes (00 through 59)
              Z - the character 'Z' denotes Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
         For example, '199502192015Z' represents 8:15pm GMT on 19 February
         1995.

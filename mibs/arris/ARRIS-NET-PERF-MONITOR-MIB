    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB indicates to the modem to run the Network Latency test. The
         supplied time is used as a countdown timer, indicating the number of 
         seconds to wait before running the test. A value of 0 means run 
         immediately. The test results for the Network Latency Test are
         made available once the test has completed. Given that there can 
         be multiple test servers configured for this test, the SNMP manager 
         should wait for at least 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the
         test results.
 
         If arrisNpmSetupNetLatencyRunUnderLoadEnable is enabled, then setting
         this MIB will not result in a test being run, as the tests are tied
         into the operation of the Web Page Download test.
   
         The Network Latency test relies on test serveres being configured 
         within the arrisNpmSetupNetLatencyServerTable. The test will not run
         if there are no entries present in that table. 

         For every server configured in that table, the CM is required to issue
         a UDP ping request and measure the time it takes to transmit and 
         receive the UDP ping response. If the 
         arrisNpmSetupNetLatencyTestPingCount has been modified then the CM 
         must repeat the UDP ping requests that number of times. The CM must 
         wait arrisNpmSetupNetLatencyTestPingInterval between UDP Ping requests.

         When performing multiple UDP Ping requests in a row, the CM must 
         maintain statistics related to the network performance of each 
         configured test server. These statistics include minimum, maximum,
         mean, mode and standard deviation, along with successful and failed
         ping attempts. All failed UDP Ping requests are excluded from the 
         generation of statisctics. A failed UDP Ping request occurs when the
         UDP Ping response is not received back from the remote server within 
         arrisNpmSetupNetLatencyTestPingTimeout seconds. "

         retrieved result can be interpretted on its own, without requiring 
         other lookups to retrieve associated data.
         Note that it is possible to exclude the <median> and <range> values

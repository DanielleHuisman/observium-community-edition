         be sent to the default gateway, if one exists.

         set to any number between 1 and (2^32 - 1), or can be set to 'infinite'
         by setting the value to 0.
        
         Note that if set to infinite, then the ping must be stopped explicitly

         be sent.  This size includes the LLC header, IP header, ICMP header, 
         and the CRC32 at the end.  You must specify values between 64 and 1518, 
         which are the min and max size Ethernet frames.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Specifies the number of bytes by which each subsequent ping packet
         is incremented.
         
         The step amount can be any number from 0 (which leaves the ping size
         constant) up to (2^32 - 1).  Note that after adding the step amount to
         the current ping size, if this is greater than the end size, then the
         current size will be wrapped around to the start size.
         
         If you want to send ping packets of the same size every time, set
         the start and end size to be equal, and the step amount to be 0.
         
         To do a sweeping ping of every packet size, set start to 64, end to
         1518, and step amount to 1.  You can set step amount to -1 to sweep in
         the other direction.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Allows the client to set the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the
         device will sleep before sending a ping.  Generally, this is the time
         between when a ping reply is received and when the next ping will be
         sent.
        
         Note that the amount of time between sending one ping and sending the
         next ping varies depending on whether or not you enable waiting for
         replies, and how long it takes to receive the reply.
        
         If waiting for replies is disabled, then this is the time between 
         sending one ping and sending the next ping.

         device should wait for a reply after sending a ping.
         
         If set to any non-negative value, then the device will send a ping and 
         wait for a response for the specified amount of time.  Event if 
         set to 0, the thread will check for and process a reply packet.
         
         If set to -1, then the device will not wait at all, and won't even 
         check for any replies.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Enables/disables verification of ping replies.  If enabled, and if 
         waiting for replies is enabled, then if a reply is received, it will 
         verify that it matches the ping that was sent, and that all of the 
         data is intact.

         sent.  Specifying 0 means that the pings will be sent from the same IP
         stack on which this MIB is hosted.

         progress when read.  If a ping is already in progress and this object
         is set to true(1), then the ping will continue but the ping statistics

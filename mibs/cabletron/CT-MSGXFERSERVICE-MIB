   -- This MIB is intended to allow quantitative & qualitative measurement
   -- of the flow of both control & data messages sent across a shared memory
   -- processor interface via the Message Transfer Service. In specific, it
   -- will provide the ability to:
   -- 1) determine if the amount of shared memory used for interprocessor
   --    messaging is being fully utilized
   -- 2) determine if the users of the shared memory are making efficient
   --    use of the message transferral service
   -- 3) determine if the Message Transfer Service is making efficient use
   --    of the shared memory interface

--	  Overview of AAA Server MIB
--
--	  MIB description
--
--
--	This MIB provides configuration	and statistics reflecting the state
--	of AAA Server operation	within the device and AAA communications
--	with external servers.
--
--	AAA stands for authentication, authorization, and accounting
--
--	The AAA	Server MIB provides the	following information:
--	 1) A Table for	configuring AAA	servers
--	 2) Identities of external AAA servers
--	 3) Distinct statistics	for each AAA function
--	 4) Status of servers providing	AAA functions
--
--	A server is defined as a logical entity	which provides any
--	of the three AAA functions. A TACACS+ server consists of
--	all three functions with a single IP address and single	TCP
--	port.  A RADIUS	server consists	of the authentication/accounting
--	pair with a single IP address but distinct UDP ports, or
--	it may be just one of authentication or	accounting. It is
--	possible to have two distinct RADIUS servers at	the same IP
--	address, one providing authentication only, the	other accounting
--	only.

casConfigEntry OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX	    CasConfigEntry
	MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
	STATUS	    current
	DESCRIPTION
	    "An	AAA server configuration identified by its protocol
	     and its index.

	     An	entry is created/removed when a	server is defined
	     or	undefined with IOS configuration commands via
	     CLI or by issuing appropriate sets	to this	table
	     using snmp.

	     A management station wishing to create an entry should
	     first generate a random number to be used as the index
	     to	this sparse table.  The	station	should then create the
	     associated	instance of the	row status and row index objects.
	     It	must also, either in the same or in successive PDUs,
	     create an instance	of casAddress where casAddress is the
	     IP	address	of the server to be added.

	     It	should also modify the default values for casAuthenPort,
	     casAcctPort if the	defaults are not appropriate.

	     If	casKey is a zero-length	string or is not explicitly set,
	     then the global key will be used.	Otherwise, this	value
	     is	used as	the key	for this server	instance.

	     Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
	     objects have been created,	either by an explicit SNMP set
	     request or	by default, the	row status should be set to
	     active(1) to initiate the request.

	     After the AAA server is made active, the entry can	not be
	     modified -	the only allowed operation after this is to
	     destroy the entry by setting casConfigRowStatus to	destroy(6).

	     casPriority is automatically assigned once	the entry is
	     made active and reflects the relative priority of the
	     defined server with respect to already configured servers.
	     Newly-created servers will	be assigned the	lowest priority.
	     To	reassign server	priorities to existing server entries,
	     it	may be necessary to destroy and	recreate entries in order
	     of	priority.

	     Entries in	this table with	casConfigRowStatus equal to
	     active(1) remain in the table until destroyed.

	     Entries in	this table with	casConfigRowStatus equal to
	     values other than active(1) will be destroyed after timeout
	     (5	minutes).

	     If	a server address being created via SNMP	exists already
	     in	another	active casConfigEntry, then a newly created row
	     can not be	made active until the original row with	the
	     with the same server address value	is destroyed.

	     Upon reload, casIndex values may be changed, but the
	     priorities	that were saved	before reload will be retained,
	     with lowest priority number corresponding to the higher
	     priority servers.

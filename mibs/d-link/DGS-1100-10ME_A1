        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them

        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

BridgeId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

     DESCRIPTION
           "The Bridge-Identifier as used in the
           Spanning Tree
           Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
           octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
           value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
           used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
           (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
           of all ports on the bridge).
           Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
           timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
           MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
           a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
           that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
           no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
           ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
           convention and all representation of these timers
           in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
           algorithm is also defined for converting between the
           different units, to ensure a timer's value is not 
		   distorted by multiple conversions."

            To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
            1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

                  To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
				  1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

 OwnerString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "This data type is used to model an administratively
         assigned name of the owner of a resource. Implementations
         must accept values composed of well-formed NVT ASCII
         sequences. In addition, implementations should accept
         values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences.

         It is suggested that this name contain one or more of
         the following: IP address, management station name,
         network manager's name, location, or phone number.
         In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
         an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
         to a string starting with 'monitor'.

         SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
         of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
         SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
         or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
         its value or the value of related object instances.
         Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
         resource contention only among cooperating
         managers; they realize no access control function
         with respect to uncooperative parties."
     SYNTAX DisplayString (SIZE (0..32))

 RmonStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The status of a table entry.

         Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
         effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
         That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
         identified with said entry.
         It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
         the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
         Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
         receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
         to entries currently not in use.  Proper
         interpretation of such entries requires examination
         of the relevant RmonStatus object.

         An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
         createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
         createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
         this object is created, the agent may wish to create
         supplemental object instances with default values
         to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the

         creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
         of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
         created, but may make use of any that are created.
         Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
         must set this object to underCreation(3).

         When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
         exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
         usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
         this state, an entry is not fully active.
         Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
         the management station is finished configuring the entry
         and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
         object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
         entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
         abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
         station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
         it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
         entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
         management station may need to wait for human input
         and will allow for that possibility in its
         determination of this abnormally long period.

         An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
         consistent and fully represents the configuration or
         operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
         example, it could be a statistical function that is
         configured and active, or a filter that is available
         in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
         process.

         A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
         the following ways:

              To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
         From:
         valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
         createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
         underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
         invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
         nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

         In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
         from the createRequest state to any other state because the
         manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
         nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
         it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.

         An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
         additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
         followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
         the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
         never exercise these additional state transitions."

TimeFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  STATUS        current
  DESCRIPTION
      "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
      to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
      Note that this is not a history mechanism.  Only current values
      of underlying objects are returned; saved instance values
      associated with particular values of sysUpTime are not.

      An entry is considered changed if the value of any object in the
      entry changes, if the row is created, or if any object in the
      entry is created or deleted.  Note that deleted entries cannot
      be detected or downloaded.

      A time-filtered conceptual table is created by inserting a
      single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX component
      in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any
      SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component).  Thus, for
      each conceptual entry 'I' in the basic table, there exists N
      conceptual entries in the time-filtered version, indexed N.I,
      where 'N' is equal to the value of sysUpTime.

      When an application retrieves conceptual instances from a
      time-filtered table, and an INDEX value is provided for the
      TimeFilter INDEX component 'N', the agent will only consider
      returning basic conceptual entries (e.g., 'fooColumn.N.I') if
      any column within the basic conceptual entry has changed since
      sysUpTime 'N'.  If not, the basic conceptual entry will
      be ignored for the particular retrieval operation.

      When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

      One conceptual entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime,
      except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

      As an entry in a time-filtered table is updated (i.e., one of
      the columns in the basic conceptual table is changed), new
      conceptual entries are also created in the time-filtered version
      (which still shares the now updated object values with all other
      instances).  The number of unique time-filtered instances that
      are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the
      basic entry was last updated.  One unique instance will exist
      for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.
      However, a new TimeFilter index instance is created for each new
      sysUpTime value.  The TimeFilter index values not associated
      with entry updates are called duplicate time-filtered instances.

      After some deployment experience, it has been determined that
      a time-filtered table is more efficient if the agent
      stops a MIB walk operation by skipping over rows with a
      TimeFilter index value higher than the value in the received
      GetNext/GetBulk request.  That is, instead of incrementing a
      TimeFilter index value, the agent will continue to the next
      object or table.  As a consequence, GetNext or GetBulk
      operations will provide only one pass through a time-filtered
      table.

      It is suggested that an agent implement a time-filtered table
      in this manner to improve performance and avoid a MIB walk
      getting stuck in time-filtered tables.  It is, however, still
      acceptable for an agent to implement a time-filtered table in
      the traditional manner (i.e., every conceptual time-filtered
      instance is returned in GetNext and GetBulk PDU responses), and
      management applications must be able to deal with such
      traditional implementations.

      See the appendix for further discussion of this textual
      convention.

      The following example is provided to demonstrate TimeFilter
      behavior:

      Consider the following basic conceptual table, basicFooTable.
      (Note that the basic version of a time-filtered table may not
      actually be defined.)

          basicFooTable:

          basicFooTable ...
          INDEX { fooIndex }

          BasicFooEntry {
             fooIndex     Integer32,
             fooCounts    Counter32
          }

      For this example, the basicFooTable contains two static
      conceptual entries (fooIndex equals '1' and '2'), created at
      time zero.  It also contains one dynamic conceptual entry
      (fooIndex equals '3'), which is created at time '3' and deleted
      at time '7'.

      The time-filtered version of the basicFooTable could be defined
      as follows:

          FooTable:

          fooTable ...
          INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

          FooEntry {
             fooTimeMark  TimeFilter,
             fooIndex     Integer32,
             fooCounts    Counter32
          }


      Note that entries exist in the time-filtered conceptual table
      only if they actually exist in the underlying (basic) table.

      For this example, the fooTable will have three underlying
      basic entries (fooIndex == 1, 2, and 3), with the following
      activity (for sysUpTime equal 0 to 9):

         - fooEntry.N.1 is created at time '0' and most recently
           updated at time '6' to the value '5'.
         - fooEntry.N.2 is created at time '0' and most recently
           updated at time '8' to the value '9'.
         - fooEntry.N.3 is created at time '3', updated at time '5'
           to the value '17', and deleted at time '7'.

     The following tables show the values that would be returned for
     MIB walk operations with various TimeFilter values, done at
     different times.  An application issues a retrieval request at
     time 'T', with a TimeFilter value, 'N' (typically set to a lower
     value, such as the value of sysUpTime at the last polling cycle).

     The following values would be returned in a MIB walk of
     fooCounts.N if T equals '0' and N equals '0':

           fooCounts.N.I    Value
           ==========================
           fooCounts.0.1    0
           fooCounts.0.2    0

       Note that nothing is returned for fooCounts.0.3, since that
       entry does not exist at sysUpTime equals '0'.

     The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB
     walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '3' and N equals '0':

           fooCounts.N.I    Value
           =======================
           fooCounts.0.1    0
           fooCounts.0.2    0
           fooCounts.0.3    0
           fooCounts.1.3    0
           fooCounts.2.3    0
           fooCounts.3.3    0

       Note that there are no instances for T equals 1 or 2 for the
       first two values of N, as these entries did not change
       since they were created at time '0'.

       Note that the current value for 'fooCounts.N.3' is returned
       here, even for values of N less than '3' (when the entry was
       created).  The agent only considers the current existence of an
       entry in the TimeFilter algorithm, not the time when the entry
       was created.

       Note that the instances 'fooCounts.0.3', 'fooCounts.1.3',
       and 'fooCounts.2.3' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
       agent in a MIB walk.

     The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
     MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '6' and N equals '3':

           fooCounts.N.I    Value
           =======================
           fooCounts.3.1    5
           fooCounts.3.3    17
           fooCounts.4.1    5
           fooCounts.4.3    17
           fooCounts.5.1    5
           fooCounts.5.3    17
           fooCounts.6.1    5

        Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.2' are returned,
        since it has not changed since time '3'.

        Note that all instances except 'fooCounts.5.3' and
        'fooCounts.6.1' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
        agent in a MIB walk.

     The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
     MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '9' and N equals '6':

           fooCounts.N.I    Value
           =======================
           fooCounts.6.1    5
           fooCounts.6.2    9
           fooCounts.7.2    9
           fooCounts.8.2    9

        Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.3' are returned,
        since it was deleted at time '7'.

        Note that instances 'fooCounts.6.2' and 'fooCounts.7.2'
        are duplicates and can be suppressed by the agent in a MIB
        walk."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This TC describes an object that counts events with the
        following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
        zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
        events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
        reached.

        Provided that an application discovers the new object within
        the minimum time to wrap, it can use the initial value as a
        delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
        part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
        this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
        discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
        defined minimum time.

        Typically, this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
        constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use."

     DESCRIPTION
         "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
		on this Ethernet segment.
		
		The value returned will depend on the location of the
		RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
		10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
		station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
		three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
		repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
		
		stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
		placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
		than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
		would.
		
		Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
		10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
		defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
		on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
		at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
		collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
		a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
		collisions.
		
		Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
		ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
		more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
		802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
		segments to which the repeater is connected."

    DESCRIPTION
            "The counter that represents the number of age-outs that
            occurred on a given port.  An age-out is the number of
            times the complete set of information advertised by a
            particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in
            sysLLDPRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because
            the information timeliness interval has expired.

            This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except
            that the counter is on a per port basis.  This enables NMS to
            poll tables associated with the sysLLDPRemoteSystemsData objects
            and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems
            on the indicated port only.

            This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization
            and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage.
            When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to
            'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with
            the same port should reset to 0.  The agent should also flush
            all remote system information associated with the same port.

            This counter should be incremented only once when the
            complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from
            all related tables on a particular port.  Partial aging
            is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of
            this counter."

    DESCRIPTION
            "This table contains one or more rows per physical network

            that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port,
            or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for
            the same local port.

            The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote
            systems information updates from an LLDP agent:

               1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems
                  and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved.
                  NMS polls periodically the values of the following
                  objects:
                     a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts
                     b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes
                     c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops
                     d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts
                     e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports.

               2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and
                  sends out notifications to a list of notification
                  destinations.

               3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new
                  values of objects listed in step 1.  

                  Periodically, NMS should poll the object
                  lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything
                  has changed since the last poll.  if something has
                  changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to
                  figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables.

                  if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed,
                  then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter
                  with the last-polled time value.  This request will
                  return new objects or objects whose values are updated
                  since the last poll.

                  if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed,
                  then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and
                  compare the new values with previously recorded ones.
                  For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is
                  greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to
                  retrieve objects associated with those ports from
                  table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is
                  performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.)

 -- The History Control Group

 -- Implementation of the History Control group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative

 --
 -- The history control group controls the periodic statistical
 -- sampling of data from various types of networks.  The
 -- historyControlTable stores configuration entries that each
 -- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
 -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
 -- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
 -- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
 -- caused the sample to be taken.  Each counter in the
 -- etherHistoryEntry counts the same event as its similarly-named
 -- counterpart in the etherStatsEntry, except that each value here
 -- is a cumulative sum during a sampling period.
 --
 -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start
 -- the first sample of the history at a time such that
 -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
 -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
 -- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
 -- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
 -- of day.
 --
 -- The probe is encouraged to add two history control entries
 -- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe a short
 -- term and a long term polling period.  Suggested parameters are 30
 -- seconds for the short term polling period and 30 minutes for
 -- the long term period.

 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
 -- variables in the probe and compares them to thresholds that have
 -- been configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
 -- entries that each define a variable, polling period, and
 -- threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to cross the
 -- threshold values, an event is generated.  Only variables that
 -- resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32,
 -- Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32, or TimeTicks) may be monitored in
 -- this way.
 --

 -- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit the generation
 -- of events.  This mechanism generates one event as a threshold
 -- is crossed in the appropriate direction.  No more events are
 -- generated for that threshold until the opposite threshold is
 -- crossed.
 --
 -- In the case of a sampling a deltaValue, a probe may implement
 -- this mechanism with more precision if it takes a delta sample
 -- twice per period, each time comparing the sum of the latest two
 -- samples to the threshold.  This allows the detection of threshold
 -- crossings that span the sampling boundary.  Note that this does
 -- not require any special configuration of the threshold value.

 -- The Event Group

 -- Implementation of the Event group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Event group controls the generation and notification
 -- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
 -- describes the parameters of the event that can be triggered.
 -- Each event entry is fired by an associated condition located
 -- elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry may also be associated
 -- with a function elsewhere in the MIB that will be executed
 -- when the event is generated.  For example, a channel may
 -- be turned on or off by the firing of an event.
 --
 -- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry
 -- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
 -- Each entry may also specify that notification should
 -- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
 -- community for the trap message is given in the associated
 -- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
 -- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
 -- triggered the event.  Two traps are defined: risingAlarm and
 -- fallingAlarm.  If the eventTable is triggered by a condition
 -- specified elsewhere, the enterprise and specific trap fields
 -- must be specified for traps generated for that condition.

                         defines a family of view subtrees.

                         Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
                         sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the
                         most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
                         string value (extended if necessary, see below)
                         corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
                         the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
                         octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
                         sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

                         Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                         the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                         determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
                         family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
                         exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
                         i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

                         Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
                         is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for
                         each sub-identifier of the value of
                         vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either:

                           the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or

                           the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
                           sub-identifier of the value of
                           vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                         If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and

                         there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                         corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                         then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
                         required length.

                         Note that when the value of this object is the
                         zero-length string, this extension rule results in

                         and the family of view subtrees is the one view
                         subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
                         instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                         Note that masks of length greater than zero length
                         do not need to be supported.  In this case this

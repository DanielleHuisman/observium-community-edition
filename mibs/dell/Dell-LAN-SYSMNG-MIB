	DESCRIPTION
		"This MIB define the common system management functions
		 applicable to all Dell Networking managed switches
		 which support SNMP management protocol.  This MIB
		 includes:
		 - Management interface access control.
		 - Local user configuration and user access control.
		 - File system management including file copy, backup,
		   restore, rename, list, etc.
		 This MIB should not be confused with the Dell Vendor
		 MIB required for ITA integration."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Management Interface Group:
-- This group defines the set of objects required to define the
-- access control for the various management interfaces supported
-- by the switch.  This includes control for the SNMP, CLI(via telnet/ssh) 
-- and Web based (http/https) management interfaces.
--
-- Note that initially the SNMP management interface must be granted
-- by the user via the switch "Easy Setup Wizard" or via the CLI
-- before the user may make configurations to the management interfaces
-- from the SNMP interface.  This means that until the user has
-- access to the switch via the SNMP interface, the user could not
-- grant himself access to the switch.  This secuirty is necessary
-- since the switch supports SNMPv1/2c which are inherently without
-- other mean of security control.
--
-- By default the management IF ACL checking is enabled, but the user may
-- disable all checking.  When the management IF ACL is enabled, the user
-- may configure a set of rules to be checked when granting access to the
-- management interface of the system.  The possible rules are:
-- * Only allow access to the switch management IF from given host (IP).
-- * Only allow access to the specific management IF.
-- * Only allow access to specific IF from specific host (IP).
-- * The rule may also be applied to a specific switch interface (e.g.
--   only to a given VLAN or LAG or OOB interface).
--
-- The user may define multiple management ACL rule set but only one may be 
-- active at any given point.  There is a limit to the number of ACL rules
-- and rule set which may be specified.  This limit is per switch type so 
-- that the system will fail to create new rules or rule set when the system
-- limit is reached.
--
-- Each rule set is given a name and rules within the rule set are given
-- priorities from 1 to 65535.  Priority 1 is the highest priority.  Rules
-- are checked from highest priority so that:
-- * the first rule to deny permission to the system will result in denied
--   access with no further checking.
-- * only if all the rules permitted access to the system would the
--   management request be granted.

         - write-only = these files may be overwritten and deleted (write),

         It will continue in this way until it finds a valid image to load.

         Note that you can even set the priority level of an image that is

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This is a conceptual table which contain only one row.  The
         row is used to setup the parameters required to execute a
         particular action on the file system.  Depending on the action,
         certain number of parameters will apply and will be required
         to be configured when the action is executed.  Once the action
         executes, the parameters set for the action will be cleared and
         the status of the action (error code or success code) will be
         available for query in the dellLanFileActionResultCode field.

         NOTE that since the action is immediately executed, all parameters
         required for the action must be given in the same SNMP set request
         in a single varbind.  The action type dellLanFileActionCommand
         must be included in each SNMP set request otherwise an error will
         be returned.

         Some of the actions may take a long time to complete, for these
         actions, the user should poll the dellLanFileActionResultCode
         until a valid result is returned.  When the system is working on
         an action this parameter will return 'statusPending'.  While the
         status is 'statusPending' the system will not honor any new
         file system request.  If the user tries to send a file system 
         action request during this time, the SNMP SET to execute the
         action will return with an SNMP error and the status will remain
         'statusPending' until the last operation has completed.

         The correct usage for this table should be:
         - first query the 'dellLanFileActionResultCode' to see if the
           system is free to execute a file action request.  If the 
           query returns 'statusPending' then don't try the action yet.
           Keep polling until the result of this parameter is something
           other then 'statusPending'.
         - once the system is ready, compose a single SNMP request with
           all parameters required for a given action (see the description
           below in the Entry definition).
         - send an SNMP SET for this request, if the SET failed with an
           SNMP error then something is wrong with the way the request is
           composed.
         - if the SNMP SET response is success, then start polling the
           dellLanFileActionResultCode to determine the status of the
           action."

    DESCRIPTION
        "There is only exactly one row in this table and the row index is
         always set to 1 (dellLanFileActionIndex = 1).  When an action is
         required to manipulate the file system, the entire action must
         be sent in the same SNMP SET request where the varbind includes
         all parameters required for the action operation and must include
         the action to be performed (dellLanFileActionCommand).  If there
         is a missing parameter or if the action command is not given, then
         an error is returned immediately and all parameters are cleared and
         the dellLanFileActionResultCode will reflect the error.  If the
         action is well formed and is properly executed, the result of the
         set will be successful and the dellLanFileActionResultCode will
         indicate a successful action.

         The following actions may be executed using this table.  Included
         with the action description is a list of all required parameters
         (which must be included in the same SNMP SET as the action itself):
         - rename    = rename the file.

                       - dellLanFileActionDestFile
         - copy      = copy a file. A copy operation requires that
                       the source and destination files are of the same
                       type of file.  For example, if the source is
                       a configuration file, then the destination must
                       also be a configuration file.  If the source is
                       an image file, then the destination must also be
                       an image file.  Note that you cannot copy on to

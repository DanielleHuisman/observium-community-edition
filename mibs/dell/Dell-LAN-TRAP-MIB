    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
       "This text string may be used to provide additional information
        regarding the trap being sent.  Any specific formatting information
        is given in the trap definition."

    }
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
      "The severity type of the enterprise-specific trap sent to the
      Network Management Station by the Dell managed device.  The
      Severity level are defined as follows:
      Critical - service affecting event.
      Major    - a major error which is not service affecting but does
                 require immediate user attention to prevent further
                 degredation of the system, which may lead to a critical
                 error.  For example, if a redundant port failure would
                 be considered a major event whereas the failure of an
                 unprotected port is a critical event.
      Minor    - a minor event which is not service affecting and is
                 unlikely to lead to a major or critical event.  The user
                 does not need to take immediate actions but some action
                 is required to clear the event.
      Info     - a notification to the user of some event that does not
                 require any user action.  For example, a security 
                 notification is useful information but does not require
                 the user to take any specific immediate action.  This
                 event is not cleared.
      Clear    - this special trap is sent to clear some previously sent
                 trap.  Note that if the sequence number sent with the
                 clear event is 0 then the clear event is used to indicate
                 that all outstanding event of this particular type on a
                 given source (dellTrapSource) has been cleared.  If the
                 event sequence number (dellTrapSeqNum) is sent with a 
                 non-zero value, then the clear event is sent to clear only
                 the specific trap instance designated by the sequence
                 number in question."
    ::= { dellAlarmGroup 2 }

dellTrapSource OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
    "The trap source is a string identifying the component of the device 
     generating the trap.  The source identifies the component associated 
     with the fault.  This may for example, identify the unit, slot, port, 
     and possibly logical ports (VLAN, LAG) from which the fault occurs.  
     The format of the source string is: 'TYPE=#:TYPE=#:...' where the
     TYPE may be one of 'unit' or 'slot' or 'port' or 'VLAN' or 'LAG'.
     For example: 
     'unit=3:slot=1:port=2' - indicates the trap comes from port 2 in slot 1
                              of the switch #3 in the stack.
     'unit=2:VLAN=10'       - indicates the trap comes from VLAN=10 in unit 2.
     'unit=1'               - indicates the trap comes from unit 1."
::= { dellAlarmGroup 3 }

dellTrapSeqNum OBJECT-TYPE
     SYNTAX Unsigned32
     MAX-ACCESS read-only
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
     "Since SNMP traps are transported using UDP, there is a possibility 
      for the trap to be lost in transit.  To allow the NMS the ability 
      to detect this possibility, all traps will include a trap sequence 
      number as part of its variable binding list.  The trap sequence number 
      may be reset each time the system reboots and will increment for each 
      trap sent from the device.  When a missing trap sequence number is 
      detected the NMS may be able to refresh its state of the switch to 
      determine what event it may have missed."
::= { dellAlarmGroup 4 }

dellTrapTimeStamp OBJECT-TYPE
     SYNTAX DateAndTime
     MAX-ACCESS read-only
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
     "The trap header includes the system up time which mark when the trap 
      was generated, but often it is important to know the absolute time 
      when the trap was generated.  This time stamp is based on GMT 
      (universal time) time zone.  This will allow the timestamps to be 
      correlated consistently across a large network."

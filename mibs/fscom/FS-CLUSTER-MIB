    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for the management of a group of
            devices called a 'cluster'.  A cluster comprises:

            1. A manager device, which is a device that can provide
               a single point of management (including SNMP, Web
               Console and CLI/Telnet Console) for the devices
               in the cluster;

            2. Zero or more expansion devicees, or called the
               cluster members throughout the context of this MIB,
               which are devices that can be managed via a manager
               device.  The manager device is also considered as a
               cluster member.  Thus it has an entry in the MIB tables
               defined below for cluster members.

            Only the manager device IP address, passwords, and SNMP
            community strings need to be configured in order to
            provide management access to members of the cluster.

            The Entity MIB is not cross-referenced from this MIB.

            To determine if a particular device can be a manager device
            or a member device please refer to the device's
            user's guide."

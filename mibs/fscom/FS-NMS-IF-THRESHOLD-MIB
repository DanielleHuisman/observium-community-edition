    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines the managed objects that support
        monitoring of thresholds on interfaces.  Configuration and
        monitoring of the thresholds is done through threshold
        templates that can be assigned to any subset of interfaces on
        the network element.  More than one threshold template can be
        assigned to a given interface.

        This MIB module should be used when it is desired to apply a
        common set of thresholds to a subset of the available
        interfaces.  If a threshold is to be applied to only one
        interface, then the EVENT-MIB or the RMON-MIB may be used as
        simpler alternatives.  If a threshold is to be applied to all
        available interfaces, then the EVENT-MIB may be used as a
        simpler alternative."

        nmsifthThresholdFiredValue or nmsifthThresholdClearedValue.

        rate of increase of nmsifthThresholdObject is to be compared to
        the negated value of nmsifthThresholdFiredValue used as the
        exponent of 10, times the value of ifSpeed (if the value of
        ifSpeed is less than the maximum value) or ifHighSpeed
        (otherwise).  For example, a value of nmsifthThresholdFiredValue
        of 5 on a gigabit ethernet interface indicates a threshold of
        10^-5 times the interface speed, which is equal to 10,000 per

        One reason for a template not to be operational on an

        occur when a template is assigned to the interface, or when a
        threshold is added to a template that is already active on the
        interface.  When this occurs, the implementation may operate on
        both (or all) threshold values, or it may take down one (or
        more) of the templates on this interface, which is indicated by

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB file is to provide the definition of failover group.

        Such as:
        1. Configure Failover Groups for a device and display Failover Groups
           and their status.
        2. Assign CPU to the Failover Group, and display their status.

        Failover Group: A failover group contains a primary node and a secondary node.
        When a failover group is referenced by a service module, the primary node
        processes services and backs up service data to the secondary node.
        The secondary node does not process services, but it takes over the services
        when the primary node fails.
        When the primary node is recovered, traffic is switched to the primary node again."

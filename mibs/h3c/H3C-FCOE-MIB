    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is for configuring and monitoring Fibre Channel
        over Ethernet (FCoE) related entities.  This MIB defines a
        Virtual FC (VFC) Interface as an object that represents either
        a VF_Port or a VE_Port on an FCoE Forwarder (FCF).  VFC
        interfaces can be created either statically (by management
        request) or dynamically (at the time of FIP based FLOGI or ELP
        request).
        Other terminologies used in this MIB are defined by the
        H3c FCoE standard, as defined in the FC-BB-5 specification.
        This MIB also supports configuration of the following objects:
        - Mapping of FCoE VLAN-ID used to carry traffic for a Fabric
        - FC-MAP value used by the FCF operating in FPMA mode
        - FIP snooping related objects"

-- FCoE Globals per Switch in a Fibre Channel Management Instance
-- Fibre Channel Management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a
-- separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
-- Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre
-- Channel management instances in whatever way is most
-- convenient for the implementation(s).
--
-- RFC4044 also defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
-- information about Fibre Channel switches which are managed
-- by Fibre Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel
-- management instance can manage one or more Fibre Channel
-- switches.  The Switch Index, fcmSwitchIndex, is
-- IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
-- to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst
-- those (one or more) managed by the same Fibre
-- Channel management instance.
-- In this MIB, the same fcmSwitchIndex is used to
-- identify each FCF and to distinguish it from other
-- FCFs and from other Fibre Channel switches.

        Lists (ACLs).  Properly configured ACLs may emulate a point-to-point
        link by providing the traffic enforcement previously discussed.
        Furthermore, the FIP protocol has been designed to enable Ethernet
        bridges to efficiently monitor FIP frames passing through them.  This
        data facilitates the automatic configuration of these ACLs.  In
        addition, the automatic configuration is possible independent of
        any other ACLs that may be in use in the network for other
        applications.  And FIP Snooping is to maintain these ACLs."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB provides objects for upgrading images on modules in the
        system, objects for showing the result of an upgrade operation,
        and objects for showing the result of a test operation.

        To perform an upgrade operation, a management application
        must first read the h3cIssuUpgradeImageTable table and use the
        information in other tables, as explained below.  You can
        configure a new image name for each image type as listed in
        h3cIssuUpgradeImageTable.  The system will use this image on the
        particular module at the next reboot.

        The management application used to perform an upgrade
        operation must first check if an upgrade operation is already
        in progress in the system.  This is done by reading the
        h3cIssuOpType ('none' indicates that
        no other upgrade operation is in progress.  Any other value
        indicates that an upgrade is already in progress and a new upgrade
        operation is not allowed.  To start an 'install' operation,
        the user must first perform a 'test' operation to examine the
        version compatibility between the given set of images
        and the running images.  Only if the result of the 'test'
        operation is 'success' can the user proceed to do an install
        operation.  The table h3cIssuTestResultTable
        provides the result of the 'test' operation performed by using h3cIssuOpType.
        The table h3cIssuUpgradeResultTable provides the result of the 'install' operation
        performed by using h3cIssuOpType.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Loopback detection action on the port on which a loop is detected.
        When a loop is detected on a port, the device generates a log.  The
        enumeration 'none(1)' means that the device performs no action on the
        port.  The enumeration 'block(2)' means that the device disables MAC
        address learning and blocks traffic on the port.  The enumeration
        'nolearning(3)' means that the device disables MAC address learning on
        the port.  The enumeration 'shutdown(4)' means that the device shuts
        down the port.  The device automatically sets the port to the forwarding
        state after the time interval configured."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB contains objects to manage MDC (Multitenant Device Context) operations.

        Such as:
        1. Configure MDCs for a device and display MDCs and their status.
        2. Assign CPU, storage space, and memory space resources to the MDC, and display their status.
        3. Authorize the MDC to use the interface cards, and assign physical interfaces to an MDC.

        Default MDC: A device supporting MDCs is an MDC itself, and it is called the default MDC.
        From the default MDC, administrators can manage the entire physical device, create and delete non-default MDCs,
        and assign interfaces, CPU resources, storage space, and memory space to non-default MDCs.

        Non-default MDC: No MDCs can be created on a non-default MDC.
        Administrators of non-default MDCs can only manage and maintain their respective MDCs.
        A non-default MDC can use only the resources assigned to it."

        "This table is used to assigning a physical interface to an MDC.
        It is allowed that allocate interfaces to a non-default MDC from the default MDC,
        and allocate interfaces back to the default MDC from a non-default MDC.

        All physical interfaces on the device belong to the default MDC,
        and a non-default MDC has no physical interfaces to use.
        Multiple physical interfaces can be assigned to a non-default MDC.
        A physical interface must meet the following conditions to be assigned to a non-default MDC:
        1. Belongs to the default MDC.
        2. Not the console or AUX port.
        3. Not the management Ethernet interface.
        4. Not in an interface group with an interface assigned to another MDC.
        5. The default MDC uses only the physical interfaces that are not assigned to a non-default MDC.

        Non-default MDC cannot set this table."

         or the default value of preferred type will be taken.
         The zero value is used to cancel the domain ID configured,
         and then, there is no need to specify its type.

         When statically build a fabric, the configured domain ID
         is the actual domain ID of the switch.  If this object is
         not manually configured, the switch will isolate all of
         its E_ports in this VSAN no matter what domain ID type is
         configured.

         When dynamically build a fabric, the configured domain ID
         is desired by the switch, but the domain ID assigned to
         the switch may not be the desired one.
         If a non-principal switch fails to obtain any domain ID
         from the principal switch, the non-principal switch will
         isolate the upstream link.
         If a non-principal switch obtains a domain ID from the
         principal switch other than the desired one, different
         actions will be taken according to different domain ID
         type configured:

            will isolate the upstream link and refuse other domain
            IDs assigned by the principal switch.
          - If configured preferred type, the non-principal switch

    DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB module describes Virtual Connect (VC) domain level MIB objects
      for HPE Virtual Connect Manager (VCM). The VCM is responsible for managing
      an entire Virtual Connect (VC) domain.
      This MIB module reports all managed objects with in the VC domain,such as
      VC Ethernet modules (Enet), VC FibreChannel (FC) modules, Physical Servers,
      network, fabrics, server profiles and associations between various VC objects.

      Keeping the limitations of SMI specifications in mind, the complex
      relationships between VC objects are represented in the form of mapping
      tables with appropriate index values to indicate the associations."

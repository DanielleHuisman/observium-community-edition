                "The table hwadsl2SCStatusTable contains status parameters
                 of the ADSL2 sub-carriers.  The following points apply to this
                 table:
                 1.  The main purpose of this table is to hold the results
                     of a DELT.
                 2.  This table also holds parameters obtained at line
                     initialization time.
                 3.  The rows in this table are volatile; that is, they are
                     lost if the SNMP agent is rebooted.
                 4.  Due to the large OCTET STRING attributes in this table,
                     the worst case memory requirements for this table are
                     very high.  The manager may use the row status attribute
                     of this table to delete rows in order to reclaim memory.
                 5.  The manager may create rows in this table.  The SNMP
                     agent may create rows in this table.  Only the manager
                     may delete rows in this table.
                 6.  The maximum number of rows allowable in this table is
                     indicated by the scalar attribute
                     adsl2ScalarSCMaxInterfaces.
                     The number of rows available in this table is indicated
                     by the scalar attribute adsl2ScalarSCAvailInterfaces.
                 7.  The SNMP agent is permitted to create rows in this table
                     when a DELT completes successfully or when line
                     initialization occurs.  It is not mandatory for the SNMP
                     agent to create rows in this table; hence, it may be
                     necessary for the manager to create rows in this table
                     before any results can be stored.
                 8.  If the manager attempts to create a row in this table
                     and there are no more rows available, the creation
                     attempt will fail, and the response to the SNMP SET PDU
                     will contain the error noCreation(11).
                 9.  If the SNMP agent attempts to create a row in this table
                     and there are no more rows available, the creation
                     attempt will fail, and the attribute
                     adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason will indicate the
                     reason for the failure.  The failure reason will be either
                     tableFull(10) or noResources(11).
                 10. An example of use of this table is as follows:
                     Step 1. : The DELT is started by setting the
                             : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
                     Step 2. : The DELT completes, and valid data is
                             : available.
                     Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                             : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                             : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
                     Step 4. : Due to a low memory condition, a row in the
                             : adsl2SCStatusTable table cannot be created at
                             : this time.
                     Step 5. : The reason for the failure, tableFull(10), is
                             : indicated in the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason
                             : attribute.
                 11. Another example of use of this table is as follows :

                     Step 2. : The DELT completes and valid data is
                             : available.
                     Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                             : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                             : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
                     Step 4. : The row creation is successful.
                     Step 5. : The value of the attribute
                             : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set
                             : to success(2).
                 12. Another example of use of this table is as follows:
                     Step 1. : The manager creates a row in adsl2SCStatusTable
                             : for a particular ADSL2 line.
                     Step 2. : The DELT is started on the above-mentioned
                             : line by setting the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from
                             : inhibit to force.
                     Step 3. : The DELT completes, and valid data is
                             : available.
                     Step 4. : The value of the attribute
                             : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set
                             : to success(2).

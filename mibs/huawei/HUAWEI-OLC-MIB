-- Description: This MIB module provides certain configuration functions for the CPU overload control feature. 
--              The functions include the configuration of the mapping relation between the OLC queue and the priority, 
--              configuration and query of the attributes in the OLC queue, and configuration and query of the parameters 
--              of the system-level leaky bucket. The CPU overload control function is used for preventing the overuse of 
--              system resources of the device. This is to ensure that the interruption of all the service and the management 
--              failure of the NMS do not occur due to the overuse of CPU or other system resources.

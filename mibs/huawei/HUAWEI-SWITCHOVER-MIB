            Manual active/standby switchover. Active/standby switchover 
            refers to the process that the standby control board works 
            as the active control board when the active control board 
            is faulty or reset, or when the switchover command is issued 
            manually. If the hwSwitchOverStatus value of the 
            hwSwitchOverControl object in the table is off(2), 
            it indicates that the switchover in the system is disabled. 
            In this case, the manual active/standby switchover cannot be 
            performed.It is advised to query the value of hwQrydatasyncondition 
            before setting this value. If the returned value of 
            hwQrydatasyncondition is synccompleteness(1), the operation is reasonable.
            This command will take no effect when the values of 
            hwAutoswitchoverSwitchStatus, hwAutoswitchoverTime,
            hwAutoswitchoverCycle and hwDayNo are set at the same time,

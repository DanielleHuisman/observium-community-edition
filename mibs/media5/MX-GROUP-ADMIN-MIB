    DESCRIPTION  "This MIB defines the administrative commands and status related to a
                  managed object. These objects are managed by the combination of three
                  attributes that are termed OSI States attributes.

                  This MIB follows ISO/IEC 10164-2 CCITT Recommendation X.731 with 
                  the following interpretations and extensions.

                  This MIB contains managable objects containers. The table
                  groupAdminTable contains group of entities that are manageable
                  uniquely (in another admin table) or in group( groupAdminTable).

                  The management state of a managed object represents the 
                  instantaneous condition of availability and operability of the
                  associated resource from the management point of view. 
                  Managed objects have a variety of state attributes that express
                  and control aspects of the operation of their associated
                  resource that are peculiar to each. However, the management
                  state is expected to be common to a large number of resources 
                  and, for this reason, is standardized; it expresses key aspects
                  of their usability at any given time. We used three primary 
                  factors to allocate the management state of a managed object.
                  These are:

                  operability    : indicates whether or not the resource is
                                   operational.

                  usage          : indicates whether or not the resource is
                                   actively in use at a specific instant and, if
                                   so, whether or not it has spare capacity for
                                   additional requests at that instant.

                  administration : indicates the current maintenance state of a
                                   group. This attribute reflects the result
                                   of an operator-initiated maintenance request.

                  The status of the managed object is closely related to the status of 
                  its children. These status are affected by external events such
                  as administrative commands. The behavior of the managed object
                  to these events is explained below.

                  event : receive an administrative lock (graceful) command 
                          for a group:

                          1) The administrative state of the group (groupAdminState) is
                             changed to SHUTTING DOWN.
                          2) All children are notified to set their usage state to
                             IDLE UNUSABLE gracefully.
                          3) The children change their usage state to IDLE UNUSABLE
                             as soon as their activities end.
                          4) When the usage state of all children have been set to 
                             IDLE UNUSABLE, the usage state of the group (groupUsageState)
                             is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          5) The administrative state of the group (groupAdminState)is
                             changed to LOCKED.

                  event : receive an administrative lock command (non graceful)
                          for a group:

                          1) All children are notified to set their usage state
                             to IDLE UNUSABLE immediately.
                          2) The children change their usage state to IDLE UNUSABLE
                             abruptly.
                          3) When the usage state of all children have been change to 
                             IDLE UNUSABLE, the usage state of the group (groupUsageState)
                             is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          4) The administrative state of the group (groupAdminState) is
                             changed to LOCKED.

                  event : receive an administrative unlock command for a group

                          1) All children are notified to set their usage state to
                             IDLE if:
                               * the administrative state of the child is

                          2) The usage state of the group (groupUsageState) is changed
                             to IDLE if:

                             is changed to UNLOCKED.
 
                  event : An operational problem is discovered with a group

                         1) All children are notified to set their usage state to 
                            IDLE UNUSABLE abruptly.
                         2) All children change their usage state to IDLE UNUSABLE
                            abruptly.

                            is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                         4) The operational state of the group (groupOpState) is changed
                            to DISABLED.
 
                  event : An operational problem is resolved in a group
 
                         1) All children are notified to set their usage state

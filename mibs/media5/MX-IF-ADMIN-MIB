    DESCRIPTION  "This MIB defines the administrative commands and status related to a
                  managed object. These objects are managed by the combination of three
                  attributes that are termed OSI States attributes.

                  This MIB follows ISO/IEC 10164-2 CCITT Recommendation X.731 with
                  the following interpretations and extensions.

                  The management state of a managed object represents the
                  instantaneous condition of availability and operability of the
                  associated resource from the management point of view.
                  Managed objects have a variety of state attributes that express
                  and control aspects of the operation of their associated
                  resource that are peculiar to each. However, the management
                  state is expected to be common to a large number of resources
                  and for this reason is standardized; it expresses key aspects
                  of their usability at any given time. We used three primary
                  factors to allocate the management state of a managed object.
                  These are:

                  operability    : indicates whether the resource is
                                   operational or not.

                  usage          : indicates whether or not the resource is
                                   actively in use at a specific instant, and if
                                   so, whether or not it has spare capacity for
                                   additional request at that instant.

                  administration : indicates the current maintenance state.
                                   This attribute reflects the result of an
                                   operator-initiated maintenance request.

                  The managed object status is closely related to the status of
                  its children. These status are affected by external events such
                  as administrative commands. The behavior of the managed object
                  to these events is explained below.

                  event : receive an administrative lock (graceful) command
                          for an interface:

                          1) The interface administrative state (groupAdminState)
                             is changed to SHUTTING DOWN.
                          2) All children are notified to set their usage state to
                             IDLE UNUSABLE gracefully.
                          3) The children change their usage state to IDLE UNUSABLE
                             as soon as their activities end.
                          4) When the usage state of all children has been set to
                             IDLE UNUSABLE, the usage state of the interface
                             (groupUsageState) is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          5) Its administrative state (groupAdminState) is
                             changed to LOCKED.

                  event : receive an administrative lock command (non graceful)
                          for an interface:

                          1) All children are notified to immediately set their
                             usage state to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          2) The children abruptly change their usage state to
                             IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          3) When the usage state of all children has been changed to
                             IDLE UNUSABLE, the usage state of the interface
                             (groupUsageState) is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                          4) Its administrative state (groupAdminState) is
                             changed to LOCKED

                  event : receive an administrative unlock command for an interface

                          1) All children are notified to set their usage state to
                             IDLE if:
                               * the child's administrative state is UNLOCKED

                          2) The usage state of the interface (groupUsageState) is set
                             to IDLE if:
                               * all the administrative states of all its parents are
                                 also UNLOCKED AND

                          3) The administrative state of the interface (groupAdminState)
                             is changed to UNLOCKED.

                  event : An operational problem is discovered with an interface

                         1) All children are notified to abruptly set their usage state
                            to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                         2) All children abruptly change their usage state to 
                            IDLE UNUSABLE.

                            IDLE UNUSABLE, the usage state of the interface
                            (groupUsageState) is changed to IDLE UNUSABLE.
                         4) Its operational state (groupOpState) is changed
                            to DISABLED.

                  event : An operational problem is resolved in an interface

                         1) All children are notified to set their usage state
                           to IDLE if:

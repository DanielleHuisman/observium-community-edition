                         Formats), July 2003 explains how the Annex B can be
                         negotiated by using the session description protocol.

                         The Annex B indicates that Annex B, voice activity
                         detection, is used or preferred. Permissible values
                         are 'yes' and 'no' (without the quotes); 'yes' is

                            In that case, the G.729 Annex B is based on the
                            MIB variable voiceIfG729VoiceActivityDetectionEnable.
                            When this variable is set to 'enable', the G.729

                            variable is set to 'disable', the G.729 codec

                            the offer. The value depends on the MIB variable
                            voiceIfG729VoiceActivityDetectionEnable. If this
                            variable is set to 'enable', then the Annex B is
                            set to 'yes'; otherwise, the value 'no' is

                            to 'no'.  This forces the offerer not to use the
                            Annex B in G.729.  However, the opposite is not
                            possible.  The answerer can NOT force the offerer to
                            use the Annex B if this one does not bear such
                            capability."

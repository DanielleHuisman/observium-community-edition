                 October 22nd, 2003
                    Updated rtpConfigBasePort variable description.
                 September 18, 2003
                    Added rtpConfig and rtpConfigBasePort.
                 September 26, 2002
                    Detailed how the latency is computed.
                 May 14, 2002
                    Added the statistics for interarrival jitter and latency.

                         The RTP/RTCP ports are allocated starting from this base port.

                         The unit may use two or four RTP/RTCP ports per FXS/FXO interface.

                         It uses 2 ports in case of a standard call, while it uses 4 ports
                         in other types of calls such as a conference call, a call transfer, etc.

                         E.g.: let's say for instance that a unit has two FXS interfaces and the
                         base port is defined on 5004:
                            - if there is currently no ongoing call and FXS connector 1 has an
                              incoming or outgoing call, it will use the RTP/RTCP ports 5004 and 5005.

                            - if there is currently a standard call on FXS connector 1 and FXS
                              connector 2 has a conference call, then FXS connector 2 will use
                              the RTP/RTCP ports 5006, 5007, 5008, and 5009, which are the next
                              available ports.

                         This variable’s semantics are different depending on protocol and/or
                         hardware platforms.

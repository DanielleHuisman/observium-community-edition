                    - Variables telephonyServicesCallForwardUnconditionnalStatus,
                      telephonyServicesCallForwardBusyStatus,
                      telephonyServicesCallForwardOnNoAnswerStatus were changed
                      to a read-write MAX-ACCESS And renamed (status changed
                      for Activation).
                      By the same token, the meaning of these three variables has
                      changed. This is reflected in their DESCRIPTION.
                 December 17, 2002
                    - The digitmap length for enabling/disabling services
                    were changed from 2..10 to 0..10. The default values were
                    changed from 2 spaces to an empty string.
                 November 25, 2002
                    - Changed telephonyServicesCallForwardDontAnswer to
                    telephonyServicesCallForwardOnNoAnswer.

                    Added range for no answer timeout
                 May 28, 2002
                    Reordered status table for basic services
                 May 23, 2002

AluFilterScope ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual-convention determines some aspects of an item's
         behavior regarding creation and use, unused entry garbage collection,
         and automated promulgation by Element Management System to
         other systems in the service domain.

         AluFilterScope is an extension of the textual-convention TItemScope.

         exclusive:

            When the scope of an item is defined as exclusive, the item can
            only be applied once, for example to a single SAP.  Attempting
            to assign the policy to a second SAP is not allowed and will
            result in an error.  If the item is removed from the exclusive
            SAP, it will become available for assignment to another
            exclusive SAP.

            A non-applied exclusive scope policy is a candidate to be removed
            from the system by a TBD garbage collection command.

            The system default policies cannot be put into the exclusive scope.
            An error will be generated if scope exclusive is executed in
            any policies with a policy-id equal to 1.

         template:

            When the scope of an item is defined as template, the item can be
            applied any number of times.  Policies with template scope
            will not be considered for deletion by a TBD garbage collection
            command; all items of scope 'template' must be deleted explicitly.

            The system default policies will always be scope template.
            An error will occur if a policy-id 1 is attempted to be
            set to scope exclusive."

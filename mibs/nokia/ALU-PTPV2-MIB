    DESCRIPTION
        "The aluPtpPortDSLogAnnoInterval represents the mean time interval
        between successive Announce messages. The interval is specified as
        the logarithm to the base 2 of the time interval in seconds. For
        example the default value of 1 corresponds to an Announce interval of
        2 seconds.
        
        The default value of aluPtpPortDSLogAnnoInterval depends on the value
        of aluPtpClockProfile. The defaults and the allowed ranges are
        defined in the below table:
        
          aluPtpClockProfile | default  | range

'g8275dot2-2016 (4)'| 1        | -3..4
        
        For ordinary slave and boundary clocks utilizing unicast negotiations,
        this is the rate at which a ptp-port will request Announce messages
        from the remote PTP clock.
 
        The aluPtpPortDSLogAnnoInterval it also determines how often the Best
        Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) is run. For example on an ordinary clocks
        with the aluPtpPortDSLogAnnoInterval set to 3, the BMCA would be run
        once every 8 seconds. On boundary clocks the ptp-port with the smallest
        aluPtpPortDSLogAnnoInterval would be used to determine how often the
        BMCA is run."

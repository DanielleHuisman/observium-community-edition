        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
          "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
          the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
          determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
          progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA
          sublayer.

          This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
          port via the rcLinkOamAdminState.

          If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
          with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2).
          Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is
          not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object
          ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
          administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
          testing(3)).

          The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
          passive mode (rcLinkOamMode) and reflects the state in which the
          OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA
          capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
          devices (rcLinkOamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
          trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
          not yet made that determination.

          The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA
          entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
          rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
          for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
          unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
          rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
          oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
          by the local device, the state moves to
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
          fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
          diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
          whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
          or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
          decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
          in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
          30.3.6.1.10).

          If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
          becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
          states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
          difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
          the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
          via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the
          aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).

          When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
          OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
          operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].

          Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
          completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
          nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
          enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface
          is in half-duplex operation.

          Ethernet-like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in
          'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
          that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
          monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
          passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA
          actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
          the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA
          entity cannot.

          The default value of rcLink3OamMode is dependent on the type of
          system on which this Ethernet-like interface resides.  The
          default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that
          this system should take on a subservient role to the other
          device connected over this interface.

          Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration
          revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs and
          potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the
          rcLinkOamOperStatus was already operational(9).

          These values are communicated to the peer via the local

          and receive OAM loopback commands.  If eventSupport(2) is set,
          then the peer OAM entity can send and receive event OAMPDUs to

          Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state
          where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) is echoed back
          over the same interface on which they were received.  In this
          state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as
          only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface.
          Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal
          data flow and should be used accordingly.

        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
          "The loopback status of the OAM entity.  This status is
          determined by a combination of the local parser and
          multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states,
          as well as by the actions of the local OAM client.  When
          operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the
          status reads noLoopback(1).

          The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4)
          can be read or written.  The other values can only be read -
          they can never be written.  Writing initiatingLoopback causes
          the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its
          peer.  This value can only be written when the status is
          noLoopback(1).  Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any
          other state has no effect.  When in remoteLoopback(3), writing
          terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate
          the termination of the loopback state.  Writing
          terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect.

          If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a
          Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local
          parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah,
          57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'.  In this
          case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any
          acknowledgment that the remote OAM entity has received its
          loopback command request.
          If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in
          loopback mode (via the remote state information as described
          in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is
          remoteLoopback(3).  If the local OAM client is in the process
          of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3,
          30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in
          DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4).  If the remote
          OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as
          indicated by its local parser state, the status is
          localLoopback(5).

          The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and
          multiplexer combination is unexpected.  This status may be
          returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but
          should not persist.

          The values of this attribute correspond to the following

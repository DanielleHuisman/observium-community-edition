        DESCRIPTION
          "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
          introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE
          802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
          802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  [802.3ah] was
          prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3
          [802.3-2002] at the time.  Since then, [802.3ah] has been
          merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005].

          In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions
          introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functionality
          of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes
          introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functions are
          not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and
          can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of
          [802.3-2002].

          An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame
          with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC
          address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a
          lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow
          Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the
          subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.  OAMPDU is used throughout
          this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol
          data unit.

          The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:

        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
          "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
          the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
          determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
          progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM
          sublayer.

          This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
          interface via the dot3OamAdminStateR.

          If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAM PDUs
          with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also,
          if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not
          up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object
          ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
          administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
          testing(3)).

          The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
          passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
          OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
          capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
          devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
          trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
          not yet made that determination.

          The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
          entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
          rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
          for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
          unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
          rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
          oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
          by the local device, the state moves to
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
          fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
          diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
          whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
          or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
          decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
          in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
          30.3.6.1.10).

          If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
          becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
          states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
          difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
          the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
          via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
          aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).

          When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
          OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
          operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].

          Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
          completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
          nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
          enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)) but the interface is
          in half-duplex operation.

          'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
          that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
          monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
          passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM
          actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
          the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM
          entity cannot.

          The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
          system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The
          default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that
          this system should take on a subservient role to the other
          device connected over this interface.

          Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration
          revision field of locally generated OAM PDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and
          potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the

          "A count of the number of frames that were dropped by the OAM
          multiplexer.  Since the OAM multiplexer has multiple inputs
          and a single output, there may be cases where frames are
          dropped due to transmit resource contention.  This counter is
          incremented whenever a frame is dropped by the OAM layer.
          Note that any Ethernet frame, not just OAM PDUs, may be dropped
          by the OAM layer.  This can occur when an OAM PDU takes
          precedence over a 'normal' frame resulting in the 'normal'
          frame being dropped.

          When this counter is incremented, no other counters in this
          MIB are incremented.

          Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization
          of the management system, and at other times as indicated by

      DESCRIPTION
          "A row in this table configures the outer tunnel used for
           carrying the PW traffic toward the PSN.
           In the case of PW labels only, it configures the interface
           that will carry the PW traffic.

           An entry in this table augments the pwMplsEntry, and is
           created automatically when the corresponding row has been
           created by the agent in the pwMplsEntry.

           This table points to the appropriate MPLS MIB module.
           In the MPLS-TE case, the three variables relevant to the
           indexing of a TE tunnel head-end (as used in the
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB) are to be configured, and the tunnel
           instance indicates the LSP that is currently in use for
           forwarding the traffic.

           In case of signaled Non-TE MPLS (an outer tunnel label
           assigned by LDP) the table points to the XC entry in the
           LSR-STD-MIB. If the Non-TE MPLS tunnel is manually
           configured, the operator configures the XC pointer to this
           tunnel.

           In case of PW label only (no outer tunnel) the ifIndex of
           the port to carry the PW is configured here.

           It is possible to associate a PW to one TE tunnel head-end
           and a non-TE tunnel together. An indication in this table
           will report the currently active one. In addition, in the
           TE case the table reports the active tunnel instance
           (i.e. the specific LSP in use).
           Any read-write object in this table MAY be changed at any
           time, however change of some objects (for example
           MPLS-TE indexes) during PW forwarding state MAY cause traffic

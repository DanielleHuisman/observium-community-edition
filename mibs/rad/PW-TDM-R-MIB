  DESCRIPTION 
      "This MIB contains managed object definitions for 
       encapsulating TDM (T1,E1, T3, E3, NxDS0) as  
       pseudo-wires over packet-switching networks (PSN). 
 
       This MIB supplements the PW-STD-MIB as in: Zelig, D.,  
       Nadeau,T. 'Pseudo Wire (PW) Management Information Base'.   
       The PW-STD-MIB contains structures and MIB associations 
       generic to Pseudo-Wire (PW) emulation. PW-specific 
       MIBs (such as this) contain config and stats for specific 
       PW types.

       -Stray packets MAY be detected by the PSN and multiplexing 
       layers. Stray packets MUST be discarded by the CE-bound IWF 
       and their detection MUST NOT affect mechanisms for detection 
       of packet loss. 
 
       -Malformed packets are detected by mismatch between the 
       expected packet size (taking the value of the L bit into 
       account) and the actual packet size inferred from the PSN and 
       multiplexing layers. Malformed in-order packets MUST be 
       discarded by the CE-bound IWF and replacement data generated 
       as for lost packets. 
 
       -Excessive packet loss rate is detected by computing the 
       average packet loss rate over the value of 
       pwTDMAvePktLossTimeWindow and comparing it with a 
       preconfigured threshold [SATOP]. 
 
       -Buffer overrun is detected in the normal operation state 
       when the CE bound IWF's jitter buffer cannot accommodate 
       newly arrived packets.  
      
       -Remote packet loss is indicated by reception of packets with 
       their R bit set.  
  
       -Packet misorder is detected by looking at the Sequence 
       number provided by the control word. 

       -TDM Fault, if L bit in the control word is set, it indicates 
       that TDM data carried in the payload is invalid due an 
       attachment circuit fault.  When the L bit is set the payload 
       MAY be omitted in order to conserve bandwidth.

    DESCRIPTION "The MIB allows several SNA clients operating at the same time to 
	             receive different session ids. Get operation on this MIB will return 
				 the next free session id number. An SNA client should then issue SET 
				 operation with the value it received. The response will be one of the 
                 following:
                 - noError.
                 - inconsistentValue in case another client has already used this session id.
				 - resourceUnavailable in case the number of active sessions has already 
				   reached the maximum. 
				 In case of success, a new session events database is allocated for the session id."

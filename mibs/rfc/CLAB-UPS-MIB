     DESCRIPTION  
       "This attribute enables the automated testing of a device's 
        battery and battery charging system when applicable. Automatic 
        battery testing is enabled by default and is performed immediately
        from a cold power start if a valid test has not been previously
        completed or if the scheduled test is due, and then repeats every
        180 days.  

        The number of days left until a battery test is scheduled to run 
        can be found using MtaDevPwrSupplyBatteryTestTime MIB. When the 
        value TestScheduled(0) is set, the battery test scheduler resumes
        at its current value.  

        When the value DisableAutoTesting(1) is set the device stops the 
        countdown timer MtaDevPwrSupplyBatteryTestTime at it's current value.
         
        When the value TestInProgress(2) is set, the device initiates the 
        battery test cycle and the MtaDevPwrSupplyBatteryTestTime object is
        reset to its default value of 180 days. This command is ignored if 
        there is a test in progress. The remaining scheduled time may be 
        skipped by issuing a value of testInProgress which will cause the 
        battery test to run immediately when AC power is present. Auto 
        testing is re-enabled (testScheduled) following the test.  

        When the test is active, the object will return the value 
        testInProgress(2), unless AC power is lost or a Full Charge has been 
        initiated. In that case, the will return the value testPending(3)."

          by decreasing the battery's recharge threshold causing it to  
          recharge less often and to maintain a lower average charge state.
          Increasing the run-time value in turn decreases the total service
          life of the battery by causing it to recharge more often and to 
          maintain a higher average charge state. Setting this value greater

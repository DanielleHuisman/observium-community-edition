PktcDectPPState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
    STATUS      current 
    DESCRIPTION 
            "This data type describes the DECT PP MAC later state
            or status indication. 
            The combination of states and status provide remote 
            debugging capabilities by knowing the actions that 
            determines e.g., the fallback to a specific state. 
            Some values may have a temporary duration and not 
            observable due their transient nature. Event logging 
            might be defined for such cases.  
 
            Below are the states definitions as defined by the DECT
            standard
            'activeLocked' 
            where the PP is synchronized to at least one RFP 
            transmission and has one or more connections in progress.
            'idleLocked' 
            where the PP is synchronized to at least one RFP transmission.
            It is able to make or receive connections, but has no 
            connections in progress.
            'activeUnlocked'
            where the PP is not synchronized to any RFP transmissions,
            and is unable to make or receive connections. 
            The PP makes occasional attempts to detect a suitable RFP
            and enter the 'IdleLocked' state.
            'idleUnlocked'
            The PP is not synchronized to any RFP and does not attempt
            to detect RFPs.

            Other values. 
            The state  'activeUnlocked' does not define any possible
            reason why the PP has not progressed into a locked state.  
            Below are possible values to report:
            'noFPInRange'
            The PP could not find any FP in range.
            'waitingEasyPairing' 
            The PP is waiting for easy pairing to be activated by the FP.
            'easyPairingFailed' 
            The FP rejects the easyPairing access rights request.  
            'easyPINFailed' 
            The FP rejects the easyPIN access rights."

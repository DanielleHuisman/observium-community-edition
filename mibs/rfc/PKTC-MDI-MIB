         It can be used as a reference point to objects related to the
         particular Media Port. For DECT Media Ports, this attribute 
         represents a unique identifier of the DECT handset (PP), 
         typically the value of 'IPEI' contained in the PUN part of the
         IPUI is used by default, and for DECT handsets of type 
         residential/default. IPEI is 36 bits, therefore, 
         the representation of this attribute is a 5-octet string 
         with the 4 MSB set to '0'. For POTs media Ports this 
         attribute has no meaning and reports a sequential number
         for the set of POTS available."

        For example: 'Office Line', 'Fax Line', telephone number, etc.

        By default the FP populates the following values:
        For POTS as 'TERM n' where n = 1..m and n=1 corresponds to 
        ifIndex = 9 
        For DECT handsets as 'handset n' where n = 1..p and p is the
        maximum number of PP supported or allowed to register, which

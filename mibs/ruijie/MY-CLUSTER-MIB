    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for the management of a group of
            devices called a 'cluster'.  A cluster comprises:

            1. A command switch, which is a device that can provide
               a single point of management (including SNMP, Web
               Console and CLI/Telnet Console) for the devices
               in the cluster;

            2. Zero or more expansion switches, or called the
               cluster members throughout the context of this MIB,
               which are devices that can be managed via a command 
               switch.  The command switch is also considered as a 
               cluster member.  Thus it has an entry in the MIB tables
               defined below for cluster members.

            Only the command switch IP address, passwords, and SNMP
            community strings need to be configured in order to
            provide management access to members of the cluster.

            The Entity MIB is not cross-referenced from this MIB.
            
            To determine if a particular device can be a command switch
            or a member switch please refer to the device's
            user's guide."

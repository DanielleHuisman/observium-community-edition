        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

IndexIntegerNextFree ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS   current
    DESCRIPTION
       "An integer which may be used as a new Index in a table.

       The special value of 0 indicates that no more new entries can be
       created in the relevant table.

       When a MIB is used for configuration, an object with this SYNTAX
       always contains a legal value (if non-zero) for an index that is
       not currently used in the relevant table. The Command Generator
       (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the
       (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET.
       When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must
       determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network
       Management Applications may attempt to create a row
       (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If
       it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command
       Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to
       an implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is in use,

       however, the SET fails.  The Network Management Application must
       then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value.

       An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the
       relevant table for which the object is providing this
       functionality."

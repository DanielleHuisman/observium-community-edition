        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of 1
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port

   MAX-ACCESS  read-write 
   STATUS      current 
   DESCRIPTION 
      " The message code to be checked against the packet. If the
      packet matches with the message code, then the packet will
      be dropped / allowed based on the action set in issExtL3FilterAction.
      The default value is 255. It means that message code is not 
      configured and need not be checked. Generally the value zero 
      will be given as default. But here, zero can be an ICMP Code 
      value. Hence 255 is given as the default value.
      A value of -1 means, the message code becomes dont care.
      Some ICMP message codes are :
           networkUnreachable(0),
           hostUnreachable(1),
           protocolUnreachable(2),
           portUnreachable(3),

       Different submodule Tracing -
         BIT 16 - Tracing in VLAN module.
         BIT 17 - Tracing in VLAN Priority module.
         BIT 18 - Tracing in VLAN redundancy module.   

       The remaining bits are reserved. The combinations of levels and submodules 
       are allowed i.e. tracing can be allowed at all failure and data path 
       level in all submodules by setting the BIT appropriately.
       For example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream, 
          00000000000000010000000000000100 will enable data path trace 
       prints in VLAN module. Multiple submodules and multiple levels can
       be combined by setting the corresponding bits.
       For example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream,
          00000000000000110000000000001100 will enable data path and 
       control plane trace prints in VLAN and VLAN priority modules.

       significant bit."

   DESCRIPTION 
      "The type of the port is by default hybrid port. 
       When configured as access port, the port can accept and send 
       only untagged frames.
       When configured as a trunk port, port is added as 
       member of all the existing VLANs and also for any new VLAN
       created. 
       When configured as hybrid port, the port can send or accept both 
       tagged and untagged frames.  
       
       hostPort, promiscuousPort are types of port in PVLAN domain.
       Behavior of host port varies based on the secondary VLAN to which
       it is configured as member port.

       If a host port is a member port of an isolated VLAN, traffic from the 
       host port is sent only to the promiscuous port of the Private VLAN and 
       the trunk port.

       If a host port is a member port of the community VLAN, traffic from the 
       port can be sent only to other ports of the community VLAN, trunk port 
       and promiscuous port of the private VLAN. 
       
       A host port can be associated with only one secondary VLAN and with
       the associated primary VLAN.

       The PVID of host port will be set the ID of the secondary VLAN
       to which it belongs to.If a host port is member port of primary VLAN, 
       but is not member port of any secondary VLAN, then its PVID will be 
       set to primary VLAN id.

       When a port is configured as a hostPort or promiscuousPort, ingress
       filtering will be enabled on that port. Also ingress filtering
       cannot be disabled on hostPort and promiscuousPort.

       Promiscuous ports should be configured as member port of primary VLAN 
       and member port of all secondary VLANs associated with that 
       primary VLAN.

       The PVID of promiscuous port will be set as the ID of the primary 
       VLAN to which it belongs to.

       Host and  promiscuous ports should be configured as untagged members
       of primary/secondary VLANs.

       When a access/hybrid port is configured as a member port of a
       primary/secondary VLAN, it becomes a host Port automatically.
       
       When the type of the port is changed from promiscuous/host to
       access/hybrid port, the port gets removed from the associated PVLAN
       domain."

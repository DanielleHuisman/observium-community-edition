      a single Pseudo wire cross connection.   
      
      None of the read-create objects values can be 
      changed when fsMsPwRowStatus is in the active(1) 
      state. Changes are allowed when the fsMsPwRowStatus 
      is in notInService(2) or notReady(3) states only.   
      If the operator need to change one of the values 
      for an active row the fsMsPwRowStatus should be 
      first changed to notInService(2), the objects may 
      be changed now, and later to active(1) in order to 
      re-initiate the signaling process with the new 
      values in effect.

      MAX-ACCESS read-write
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
        "This object is used to enable Trace Statements in  
        Radius Module. 

        A FOUR BYTE integer is used for enabling the level of tracing.  
        Each BIT in the four byte integer, represents a particular  
        level of Trace.  

        The maping between the bit positions & the level of trace is  
        as follows:  
        0 - Error Traces 
        1 - Event Traces 
        2 - Packet Traces 
        3 - Response Traces 
        4 - Timer Traces 

        The remaining bits are unused. Combination of levels are  
        also allowed. 

        For example if the bits 0 and 1 are set, then the Trace 
        statements related to Error and Event
        will be printed. 

        The user has to enter the corresponding INTEGER VALUE for the 
        bits set. For example if bits 0 and 1 are set then user has to  
        give the value 3."

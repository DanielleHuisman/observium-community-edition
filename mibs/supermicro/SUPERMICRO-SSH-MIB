sshVersionCompatibility      OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX      TruthValue 
   MAX-ACCESS  read-write 
   STATUS      current 
   DESCRIPTION 

   "This object is to configure the SSH version compatibility mode.
   When set to TRUE, both SSH version-1 and SSH Version-2 will be supported.
   When set to FALSE, SSH version-2 only will be supported.

   By default SSH version-2 is supported."

sshCipherList OBJECT-TYPE
      SYNTAX Integer32(1..3)
      MAX-ACCESS read-write
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
      
      "This object is to configure the cipher-suites list.

      This object takes values as bit mask.  Setting a bit indicates that the 
      corresponding cipher-list will be used for Encryption. 

      The value of each bit position is as given below with bit 0 being the 
      least significant bit:
           BIT 3 - AES-CBC-256
           BIT 2 - AES-CBC-128 
           BIT 1 - DES-CBC
           BIT 0 - 3DES-CBC
       DES-CBC is the default algorithm in NON-FIPS mode.
       3DES-CBC is the default algorithm in FIPS mode."

      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION

      "This object is to configure the MAC-list.

      This object takes values as bit mask. Setting a bit indicates that the 
      corresponding MAC-list will be used for authentication. 

      The value of each bit position is as given below with bit 0  being the 
      least significant bit: 
            BIT 1 - HMAC-MD5
            BIT 0 - HMAC-SHA1"

sshTrace     OBJECT-TYPE
         SYNTAX        Integer32
         MAX-ACCESS    read-write
         STATUS        current
         DESCRIPTION
         "Set the trace level for SSH.
            BIT 0 - Initialisation and Shutdown Trace.
            BIT 1 - Management trace.
            BIT 2 - Data path trace.
            BIT 3 - Control Plane trace.
            BIT 4 - Packet Dump.
            BIT 5 - OS Resource trace.
            BIT 6 - All Failure trace (All failures including Packet Validation)
            BIT 7 - Buffer Trace.
            BIT 8 - SSH Server Trace.
            
            Note:BIT 0 - Least significant bit
                 BIT 7 - Most significant bit

            For example,setting the trace level to the value -0001 0101, 
            will enable Init-Shutdown, data path and packet dump trace levels.

            Setting all the bits will enable all the trace levels and 
            resetting them will disable all the trace levels."

        DESCRIPTION
        "This object is used to configure the maximum number of bytes allowed in an SSH transport connection. The SSH connection will be allowed only if the packet size does not exceed the value configured in this object and dropped otherwise."

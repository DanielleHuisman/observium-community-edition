                A management station wishing to create an entry should
                first generate a random serial number to be used
                as the index to this sparse table.  The station should
                then create the associated instance of the row status
                and row index objects.  It __MUST__ in the same PDUs, 
                create an instance of copySourceFileType and copyDestFileType.
                At least one of the FileTypes must be an agent-config
                file type (i.e.        startupConfig or runningConfig).
                If one of the file types is a networkFile, a valid
                copyServerAddress and copyFileName must be
                created as well. For a file type of localFile, only
                a valid fileName needs to be created as an extra 
                parameter.

                It should also modify the default values for the other
                configuration objects if the defaults are not 
                appropriate.
                
                Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
                objects have been created, the row status will automatically 
                be set to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
                procedure __MUST__ be initiated via a single set request 
                which specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as
                specifies valid values for the non-defaulted 
                configuration objects.

                Once the config-copy request has been created (i.e. the
                copyEntryRowStatus has been made active), the entry
                cannot be modified - the only operation possible
                after this is to delete the row.

                Once the request completes, the management station 
                should retrieve the values of the status objects of 
                interest, and should then delete the entry.  In order 
                to prevent old entries from clogging the table, 
                entries will be aged out, but an entry will never be 
                deleted within 5 minutes of completing."

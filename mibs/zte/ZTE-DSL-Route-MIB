		SYNTAX			IpAddress
		MAX-ACCESS		not-accessible
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"DURABLE:
             The static route host or subnet IP destination address.
             Note that TMS supports up to one default route (0.0.0.0) entry.
             All other IP destination addresses must be non-zero."

		DESCRIPTION		"DURABLE:
             The mask for this IP destination.  It contains 1's in the
             bit positions for the net and subnet IDs and 0's in the
             bit positions for host ID.  The 1's must be contiguous,
             starting with the left most bit.
             
             Note that a host route uses a 255.255.255.255 mask."

	zxDslIpStaticNextHop	OBJECT-TYPE	
		SYNTAX			IpAddress
		MAX-ACCESS		read-create
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"The IP address of the next hop of this route.
            (In the case of a route bound to an interface
            which is realized via a broadcast media, the value
            of this field is the agent's IP address on that
            interface.)"

		SYNTAX			DisplayString  ( SIZE ( 0 .. 16  ) )

		::=  {  zxDslIpStaticRouteEntry  4  }


	zxDslIpStaticUseHw	OBJECT-TYPE	
		SYNTAX			TruthValue
		MAX-ACCESS		read-create
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"DURABLE: { false:all )
             By setting this object to true(1), the user indicates the
             desire to use hardware routing for this entry.  To disable
             hardware routing for this entry, set this object to false(2).
             If the underlying switch fabric does not support hardware
             routing, this object is ignored.

             There is usually limited space in the hardware routing table.
             Consequently, if the user enables hardware routing on 'too'
             many entries, the agent assigns routes on a first come, first
             serve basis (i.e., the user may not get the expected results)."
		::=  {  zxDslIpStaticRouteEntry  5  }


	zxDslIpStaticInHw	OBJECT-TYPE	
		SYNTAX			TruthValue
		MAX-ACCESS		read-only
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"If this object is true(1), this static route is actually in
             the hardware Route Table.  Otherwise it is false(2)."
		::=  {  zxDslIpStaticRouteEntry  6  }


	zxDslIpStaticRowStatus	OBJECT-TYPE	
		SYNTAX			RowStatus
		MAX-ACCESS		read-create
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"DURABLE:
             This object indicates the status of this entry.  A row in this
             table must be created using the createAndWait(5) action state
             (i.e., createAndGo(4) is not supported).  This object can only
             be set to active(1) after all objects for this row are valid.
             The 'tmsL3IpStaticName' is optional.
             
             Note that the notInService(2) state is not supported.  Objects
             in this table row can be changed when this object is notReady(3)
             or active(1)."
